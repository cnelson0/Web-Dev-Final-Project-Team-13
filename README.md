How to run:

Open 2 terminals, one for frontend and the other for backend, 
making sure both start in the root project directory

Frontend terminal:
cd Client
npm install //If node_modules and package-lock are included and up to date, skip this step
nmp start

Backend terminal:
cd Server
npm install //Same deal as with the frontend terminal npm install
node server.js
